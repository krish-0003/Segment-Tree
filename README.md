# Segment-Tree
We have done this Project Using Cpp and Python (For GUI representation in Tkinter)



1. Using C++
    1. SegTreeSum.cpp
    2. SegTreeMin.cpp
    3. SegTreePolinomialQuery.cpp




2. Using Python and Tkinter Library
    1. treemin.py 
    2. rangesum.py 

## Operation

In Range Updation and Query, we have used Lazy Propogation, which will give us a time complexity of O(logn).


### In both segment tree (Min and Sum) :: 
* Rage Updation by Specific value
* Range Updation by Incrementing value

## dependencies:
Tkinter
