# Segment-Tree
We have done this Project Using Cpp and Python (For GUI representation in Tkinter)


 1.Using C++
-> SegTreeSum.cpp 
-> SegTreeMin.cpp


2. Using Python and Tkinter Library
-> treemin.py 
-> rangesum.py 

## Operation

In Range Updation and Query, we have used Lazy Propogation, which will give us a time complexity of O(logn).

In both segment tree (Min and Sum) :: 
1.Rage Updation by Specific value
2.Range Updation by Incrementing value

dependencies:
Tkinter
